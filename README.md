# Stork
A small footprint scripting language with C++ integration.

Finally, the compiler is implemented in this version. You can edit the file source/test.stk, run compiled executable and it will call the function main() from the Stork script.

This project is a work in progress. It is tested under Xcode on Mac. You should be able to compile it with C++17 standard on any platform.
